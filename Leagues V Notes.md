<h1 id="leagues-v">Leagues V</h1>
<h2 id="combat-masteries">Combat Masteries</h2>
<h3 id="melee">Melee</h3>
<p>Very swingy damage with potential to get lots of echo hits and dmg splats all at once.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tough to get going early, but very strong once you get zombie axe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="range">Range</h3>
<p>Very consistent damage with a high floor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong at combat mastery 3, when 2 tick weapons like knifes and blowpipes get reduced to 1 tick.</li>
<li>Combat Mastery 6 (Never Miss) unexpectedly strong, especially since it was paired with prayer penetration passive. Could solo 500 TOAs standing still with blowpipe.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mage">Mage</h3>
<p>Very high max hits, but inconsistent damage compared to range and melee.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong early when regular ironman accounts rely on magic for bossing, but fell off hard on late-game bossing and raids.</li>
<li>Shadow outclassed by even the 3 CM dygore blowpipe.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="relics">Relics</h2>
<h3 id="tier-1">Tier 1</h3>
<p>Animal Wrangler</p>
<ul>
<li>Very strong at all points of the league</li>
<li>Gave best opportunity for AFK’ing since you could karambwan fish without the spot moving</li>
</ul>
<p>Lumberjack</p>
<ul>
<li>Who seriously took this relic?</li>
</ul>
<p>Power Miner</p>
<ul>
<li>Trains the more boring/difficult to train skills in this tier</li>
<li>Provides a source of materials for ammo if going range</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tier-2">Tier 2</h3>
<h3 id="tier-3">Tier 3</h3>
<p>Clue Compass</p>
<ul>
<li>Just don’t take anything else</li>
<li>Was very OP for pushing points early on, still a decent amount of points behind clues</li>
<li>Had very good teleports outside of clues as well</li>
</ul>
<p>Bank Heist</p>
<ul>
<li>Taken by JCM</li>
<li>Seems like it could be the best option if you are looking strictly at maxing</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tier-4">Tier 4</h3>
<h3 id="tier-5">Tier 5</h3>
<p>Treasure Arbiter</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems like overkill with the clue compass</li>
</ul>
<p>Production Master</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes pushing points and relics easier</li>
<li>Very Fast 99’s in Fletching, Crafting, and Cooking</li>
</ul>
<p>Slayer Master</p>
<ul>
<li>Good for early slayer push</li>
<li>Strong if you are melee and dependent on slayer items</li>
<li>Can easily get 99 slayer without this relic</li>
<li>Made extra good by bug (not sure if bug) giving slayer helm bonus damage in raids</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tier-6">Tier 6</h3>
<p>Total Recall</p>
<ul>
<li>Very strong if you pair it with something like weapon specialist</li>
</ul>
<p>Banker’s Note</p>
<ul>
<li>Just goated</li>
<li>Better for skilling and PVM’ing</li>
<li>Enables Inferno for more people</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tier-7">Tier 7</h3>
<p>Pocket Kingdom</p>
<ul>
<li>WTF</li>
</ul>
<p>Grimoire</p>
<ul>
<li>Very strong with melee build</li>
<li>Very good if not taking Kourend</li>
<li>Thralls seem basically useless when you do so much DPS</li>
</ul>
<p>Overgrown</p>
<ul>
<li>Not nearly as good as trailblazer farming relic</li>
<li>Running out of seeds became pain in the ass</li>
<li>Refilling your seed vault if you ran out did not kick  farming cycle backoff</li>
</ul>
